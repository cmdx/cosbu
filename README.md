# COSBU - A utility to back up object storage using a simple Docker container with rclone and shell scripts.
It can run in any environment, but was designed to run on a cloud provider's serverless infrastructure, 
so that COS back up will not incur egress charges.  It has only been tested on IBM's Code Engine service.
